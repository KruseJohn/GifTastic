### Instructions:

#### Enter a superhero name into the search box and click the "bomb" to submit. After you submit a name, a new button will appear in the list of buttons with the Superhero name. Click on your new button and ten gifs related to that character will appear below. There are buttons already populated on the page if you are not sure of a name to search.

#### The ten gifs that appear will be shown as still images.  Click on the gif to animate it.  If you wish to stop the animation, click the gif again.  You may add more gifs to the page as well.  The page will populate with ten more gifs with each button click.  Under each gif within the gif holder is the rating and a favorite button.  If you select a gif as a favorite, it will display on your "favorites" page.  Simply click the favorite button again to remove the gif from your "favorites" page.  To access the "favorites" page, look for the round animated gif that cycles through various well known superhero characters.  Press it to access your favorite Superheroes!
